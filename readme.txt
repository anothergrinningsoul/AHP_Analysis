
To use:

Your data file needs to be .xlsx and contain only your Time and Voltage data points
starting at the very first cell of the spreadsheet. Also, the sheet containing
your data needs to be named 'Sheet1' 

Run the script named 'Execute.py' with python. 

To do this, open a terminal window in the directory containing
the 'Execute.py' script as well as the 'AHP_Analysis_Engine.py' script, then type 'python .\Execute.py\'
and press enter.

In version 2.0: 

- Use dialog boxes to select your input and output files so 
  that now the only command line input is to run the script

- Constrained some of the imports in hopes that the script 
  would start faster. This didn't seem to work so I'll look 
  for other things that might be slowing it down.
